# Python Basics: Variables, Operators, Input/Output
# Q.1. Write a Python program to store your name in a variable and print a welcome message.
# name = "Jitendra"
# print("Hello", name)

# # Create a variable a = 10 and b = 5. Print their sum, difference, and product.

# a = 10
# b = 5
# sum=a+b
# diff=a-b
# product=a*b
# print("sum of a and b is", sum)
# print("diffrence between a and b is", diff)
# print("Product of a and b is", product)

# Write a program to take input of your age and display: "You are X years old".

# age=int(input("Enter your age:"))
# print(f"You are {age} years old")

# Assign three values to variables in one line and print them.
# name, age, city="Jitendra", "29", "Cuttack"
# print(name, age, city)

# Write a program to check if two numbers (input by user) are equal.
# Num1=int(input("enter a number:"))
# Num2=int(input("enter a number:"))
# if Num1==Num2:
#     print("Both the numbers are equal")
# else:
#     print("Both the numbers are not equal")

# Use the not operator to reverse a boolean expression.
    



# Find the floor division and modulus of 17 and 4.
# floor=17//4
# modulus=17%4
# print(floor)
# print(modulus)


# Take two inputs: a name and a city, and print a formatted string using f-strings.
# name=input("Enter your name:")
# city=input("Enter your city:")
# print(f"My name is {name} and i live in {city}")



# Check if the character 'e' exists in the string "elephant".

# word="elephant"
# if "e" in word:
#     print("e exists in the string elephant")
# else:
#     print("e not present")


# Use the is operator to compare two identical integers.

# a=5
# b=5
# if a is b:
#     print("a equal to b")



# Use the += operator to increase a number from 5 to 15 by adding 10.

# a=0

# while a<=10:
#     print(a)
#     a+=1

# Write a program to display the result of (6 > 3) and (4 == 4).

# result=(6>3) and (4==4)
# print(result)


# Take a string input and use print() to print each word with a Space in between (use sep=' ').

# name="Jitendra"
# words=list(name)
# print(words, sep='_')

# Write a program using input() to take a name and age and print a greeting like: â€œHi John, you are 21 years old!

name=input("Enter your name:")
age=int(input("Enter the age:"))
print(f"Hi {name}, you are {age} years old")
